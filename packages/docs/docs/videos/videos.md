You can watch video examples of some Zmaj features.

This videos are generated from Zmaj's Playwright tests.
Currently, they do not show scrolling, mouse and keyboard events.
Every video starts from empty page, so first 2-3 seconds are empty.
It's not ideal, and maybe in the future there will be manually recorded videos,
but this might provide useful to someone.
